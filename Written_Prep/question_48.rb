# What is Bundler and why is it useful?

=begin
Bundler is a RubyGem, and is a widely used dependency manager. It allows us to
configure which Ruby and Gems each of our projects need. It lets us specifically
install multiple versions of each Gem under a specific version of Ruby, and then
use the proper version in our application.
