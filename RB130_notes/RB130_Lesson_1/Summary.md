This lesson is just the beginning into your foray into the world of closures. Closures as a whole is at the core of many programming languages, so start to get comfortable with the idea of unnamed "chunks of code" you can pass around and execute later.

Specifically we saw:

- blocks are just one way Ruby implements closures. Procs and lambdas are others.
- closures drag their surrounding context/environment around, and this is at the core of how variable scope works.
- blocks are great for pushing some decisions to method invocation time.
- blocks are great for wrapping logic, where you need to perform some before/after actions.
- we can write our own methods that take a block with the `yield` keyword.
- when we `yield`, we can also pass arguments to the block.
- when we `yield`, we have to be aware of the block's return value.
- once we understand blocks, we can re-implement many of the common methods in the Ruby core library in our own classes.
- the `Symbol#to_proc` is a nice shortcut when working with collections.
