#### What is a closure?

- A ***closure*** is a general programming concept that allows programmers to save a "chunk of code" and execute it at a later time
- It's called a "closure" because it binds its surrounding artifacts (i.e., names like variables and methods) and build an "enclosure" around everything so that they can be referenced when the closure is later executed
	- Think of a closure as a method that you can pass around an execute, but it's not defined with an explicit name

#### How do we implement closures in Ruby?

- Implemented through a `Proc` object, a lambda, or a block.
	- We can pass around these items as a "chunk of code" and execute them later.
	- Key thing to remember: this "chunk of code" retains references to it's surrounding artifacts - it's ***binding***

#### How do we work with closures in Ruby?

1. Instantiating an object from the `Proc` class
2. Using **lambdas**
3. Using **blocks**

For the most part, we will ignore lambdas; however, you should try to remember that lambdas are one way to work with closures in Ruby.
