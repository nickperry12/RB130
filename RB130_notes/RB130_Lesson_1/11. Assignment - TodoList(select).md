In this assignment, you are to build a `TodoList#select` method, very similar to `Array#select` or the `select` method we build ourselves previously.

Take a look at the following code examples for how it should behave:

```ruby
todo1 = Todo.new("Buy milk")
todo2 = Todo.new("Clean room")
todo3 = Todo.new("Go to gym")

list = TodoList.new("Today's Todos")
list.add(todo1)
list.add(todo2)
list.add(todo3)

todo1.done!

results = list.select { |todo| todo.done? }    # you need to implement this method

puts results.inspect
```

If we run the above code, we should get this output:

```ruby
[#<Todo:0x007fd88c0ad9f0 @title="Buy milk", @description="", @done=true>]
```

This is an array which contains all done todos from `list`. 
- In this case, there's only 1 todo that's done, so there's only one element in the array
