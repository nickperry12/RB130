This will cover a short introduction to the most commonly used Ruby tools.
- LS teaches these tools as they come up in the curriculum.
- Because they're covered elsewhere, this guide doesn't spend too much time teach you how to use these tools.
- The concentration is instead on a handful of tools and about how they fit into the world of Ruby development and your computer system.

The information presented here aims at showing what these tools do, how they do it and how they interact with your computer, and how you can diagnose and even fix problems that arise from their use.
- The goal here is to help you formulate a mental model of how these pieces fit together.
	- With that mental model, you have a realistic chance at debugging tricky environment issues.
