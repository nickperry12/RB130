In this lesson, we hope that you got a good overview of what writing tests is like. The goal was to both be instructive, and also reveal how easy testing is. When talking about testing within web development, it can be very confusing. We've tried to distill testing down to its core fundamentals, so you can get started with testing in all of your code.

As you move forward, don't forget the following:

- Minitest is Ruby's default testing library. It comes installed with Ruby.
- Minitest tests come in 2 flavors: assert-style and spec-style. Unless you really like RSpec, use assert-style.
- A test suite contains many tests. A test can contain many assertions.
- Use `assert_equal` liberally, but don't be afraid to look up other assertions when necessary. Remember that `assert_equal` is for asserting value equality as determined by the `==` method.
- Use the SEAT approach to writing tests.
- Use code coverage as a metric to gauge test quality. (But not the only metric.)
- Practice writing tests -- it's easy!
