Minitest is Ruby's default testing library and is part of Ruby's standard library.
- Specifically, it's a bundled gem, which means Minitest is shipped with the default Ruby installation, but is maintained outside the Rub core team and can be uninstalled if necessary.

From a purely functional standpoint, Minitest can do everything RSpec can.
- However, Minitest provides a simpler and more straightforward syntax.
- RSpec bends over backwards to allow developers to write code that reads like natural English, but at the cost of simplicity.

RSpec is what we call a **Domain Specific Language**; it's a DSL for writing tests.

Minitest can also use a DSL, but it can also be used in a way that reads like ordinary Ruby code without a lot of magical syntax.

## Vocabulary

In the world of testing, a whole new vocabulary is necessary to talk about the new concepts.
- There is a lot of jargon when working with tests, but for now, we'll just focus on a few terms below.

1. **Test Suite**: this is the entire set of tests that accompanies your program or application. You can think of this as *all the tests* for a project.
2. **Test**: this describes a situation or context in which tests are run. For example, this test is about making sure you get an error message after trying to log in with the wrong password. A test can contain multiple assertions.
3. **Assertion**: this is the actual verification step to confirm that the data returned by your program or application is indeed what is expected. You make one or more assertions within a test.

For now, we'll just use the above 3 terms, so ***SO KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN!***

## Your First Test

Let's start with a simple `Car` class. Create a file called `car.rb` and include the following code.

```ruby
class Car
	attr_accessor :wheels

	def initialize
		@wheels = 4
	end
end
```

In that same directory, create another file called `car_test.rb` with the following code:

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
	def test_wheels
		car = Car.new
		assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
	end
end
```


Note that Minitest can be written as MiniTest. You can write the name either way in your code or in descriptions of the package.

When we run the above code, we should see an output similar to this:

```
$ ruby car_test.rb

Run options: --seed 62238

# Running:

CarTest .

Finished in 0.001097s, 911.3428 runs/s, 911.3428 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

This output means our test passed. Look at the last line: `1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors`.
- This means the assertion was executed, and there weren't any problems.
	- That's the core of using Minitest

## What's in the test file

Let's take a closer look at what's actually in the test file, `car_test.rb`, and break it down line by line.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def test_wheels
    car = Car.new
    assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
  end
end
```

On line 1 is `require 'minitest/autorun'`, which loads all the necessary files from the `minitest` gem.
- This is all we need to use Minitest

On line 3, we require the file that we're testing, `car.rb`, which contains the `Car` class. We use `require_relative` to specify the file name from the current file's directory.
- Now when we make references to the `Car` class, Ruby knows where to look for it.

Line 5 is where we create our test class.
- This class must subclass from `MiniTest::Test`.
	- This allows our `CarTest` class to inherit all the necessary methods for writing tests.

Within our `CarTest` class, we can write tests by creating an instance method that starts with **test_.**
- Through this naming convention, Minitest will know that these methods are individual tests that need to be run.

Within each test (or instance method that starts with "test_"), we will need to make some *assertions*.
- These assertions are what we are trying to verify.

However, before we can make any assertions, we have to first set up the appropriate data or objects to make assertions against.
- On line 7, we first instantiate a `Car` object, and use this object in our assertion to verify that newly created `Car` objects indeed have 4 wheels.

There are many types of assertions, but for now, just focus on `assert_equal`.
- Since we are inside an instance method, you can guess that `assert_equal` is an inheritance instance method from somewhere up the hierarchy.

`assert_equal` takes two parameters: the first is the expected value, and the second is the test or actual value.
- If there's a discrepancy, `assert_equal` will save the error and Minitest will report that error to you at the end of the test run.

It's sometimes useful to have multiple assertions within one test (ie, instance method starts wtih "test_"), but in the beginning, we'll only show one assertion within one test.

## Reading test output

If everything goes well, you'll see outputs like this:

```
Run options: --seed 62238

# Running:

CarTest .

Finished in 0.001097s, 911.3428 runs/s, 911.3428 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

There are many options in Minitest, including various formatting options, but by default, the output looks like the above.

The first "seed" tells Minitest what order the testes were run in.
- In our example, we only have 1 test, but most test suites have many tests that are run in random order.
- The "seed" is how you tell Minitest to run the entire test site in a particular order
	- This is rarely used, but sometimes helpful when you have an especially tricky bug that only comes up when certain specific situations come up.

The next important this to notice is the dot.

```
CarTest .
```

There's only 1 here, so it looks like an inconsequential period, but it's very important.
- That means the test was run and nothing went wrong.
- If you skip a test with the `skip` keyword, it'll say "S".
	- If you have a failure, it'll say "F".

Pay attention to that to see if you have a failing test.

## Failures

Let's add another test, but purposefully make it fail.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
	def test_wheels
		car = Car.new
		assert_equals(4, car.wheels)
	end

	def test_bad_wheels
		car = Car.new
		assert_equals(3, car.wheels)
	end
end
```


Output:

```
Run options: --seed 41381

# Running:

.F

Finished in 0.007178s, 278.6447 runs/s, 278.6447 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
CarTest#test_bad_wheels [car_test.rb:13]:
Expected: 3
  Actual: 4

2 runs, 2 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Notice a couple of differences.
- The last line gives us a quick summary, and we can see that there are now 2 assertions and 1 failure.

Minitest further gives us the exact failing test, and also tells us the expected value vs the actual value.

Also notice at the top, there's a "F.", which means there were 2 tests, once of which failed (that's the "F") and one of which passed (that's the ".").

## A dash of color

The default Minitest output is quite bland, but you can easily add color to the output with the `minitest-reporters` gem. 

First, install the gem.

```
gem install minitest-reporters
```

Then, at the to of your test file, include the following lines:

```ruby
require "minitest/reporters"
Minitest::Reporters.use!
```

And this will change our output to:

![[Pasted image 20230614135240.png]]

**Note**:
- `minitest/reporters` suppresses the line that shows S, F and dots that indicate what happened with the test.

## Skipping Tests

Sometimes you'll want to skip certain tests. Perhaps you're in the middle of writing a test, and do not want to run it yet, or for any other reason.
- Minitest allows for this via the `skip` keyword.
- Place the `skip` keyword at the beginning of the test, and Minitest will skip it
	- It will also report that you have skipped tests in your suite, and output an "S" instead of a dot.

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'
require "minitest/reporters"
Minitest::Reporters.use!

require_relative 'car'

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def test_wheels
    car = Car.new
    assert_equal(4, car.wheels)
  end

  def test_bad_wheels
    skip
    car = Car.new
    assert_equal(3, car.wheels)
  end
end
```

This gives us the following output:

![[Pasted image 20230614141514.png]]

Notice that with Minitest Reporters, the skipped test is represented in yellow and is highlighted showing that you should go back and take care of it.

You can also pass a string into `skip` if you want a more custom display message.

## Expectation Syntax

Thus far, we've been using the *assertion* or *assert-style* syntax. Minitest also has a completely different syntax called *expectation* or *spec-style* syntax.

In expectation style, tests are grouped into `describe` blocks, and individual tests are written with the `it` method.
- We no longer use assertions, and instead use *expectation matchers*. 
	- When written out, it reads very nice.

Let's look at an example

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

require_relative 'car'

describe 'Car#wheels' do
	it 'has 4 wheels' do
		car = Car.new
		_(car.wheels).must_equal 4 # this is the expectation
	end
end
```

There's a lot of magic going on, we won't spend too much time deciphering it. Note that this DSL doesn't look like "normal" Ruby code, and where did that `must_equal` method come from?
- Don't worry about that for now

This will give us the following output:

```
Run options: --seed 51670

# Running:

Car#wheels .

Finished in 0.001067s, 937.0051 runs/s, 937.0051 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

This looks the same as using assertion style!
- That's the point -- using either assertion of expectation syntax is a style choice
- Some people prefer he expectation syntax because it mimics RSpec's syntax
	- But, in this course, we're going to stick with the more intuitive assertion style

## Summary

Getting started with Minitest is very simple. 

In this lesson, you should have gotten a quick taste of how to run your first test using Minitest. Here are the other things you learned:

- Minitest is an intuitive test library. It comes installed with Ruby
- Using Minitest is very easy, and you shouldn't be afraid to play around with it
- Create a test file
- Create a test class by subclassing `MiniTest::Test
- Create a test by creating an instance method that starts with `test_` 
- Create assertions with `assert_equal`, and pass it the expected value and the actual value
- Colorize Minitest output with `minitest-reporters`
- You can skip tests with `skip`
- Minitest comes in two syntax flavors: assertion style and expectation style. The latter is to appease RSpec users, but the former is far more intuitive for beginning Ruby developers.

There's a lot more depth to learning testing, but this is enough to get started.
