When writing tests, we want to get an idea of *code coverage*, or how much of our actual program code is tested by a test suite.
- We can see from our `TodoList` tests that all of our public methods are covered.
- If we are measuring code coverage based on testing the public methods, we could say that we achieved 100% code coverage.
	- Important to note that even though we are only testing public code, code coverage is based on all of your code, both public and private

Also, this doesn't mean every edge case is considered, or even that our program is working correctly.
- It only means that we have some tests in place for every method

There are other ways to measure code coverage too besides looking at public methods.
- More sophisticated tools can help with ensuring that all branching logic is tested.

While not foolproof, code coverage is one metric that you can use to gauge code quality.

There are many code coverage tools, but we'll use a very simple to use one called `simplecov`.

To get started, install the `simplecov` gem.

```terminal
$ gem install simplecov
```

Next, put this at the top of the test file.

```ruby
require 'simplecov'
SimpleCov.start
```

That's it! Next time you run `todolist_test.rb`, you should see a new directory in the file system called `coverage`. 
- Open up the `index.html` file in that directory, and you should see something like this:

![[Pasted image 20230620220047.png]]

It looks like `simplecov` considers our test suite to be at 92% coverage.

This should inform us to add more tests so that the code coverage should get closer to 100%.
- It's not always necessary to get to 100%, but the percentage should depend on the type of project you work on.
	- The more fault tolerant it has to be, the higher the test coverage.

```
If you click through on a file name, you'll see a color-coded listing: green is lines covered, red is lines missed, and relevant lines is lines covered + lines missed.
```
