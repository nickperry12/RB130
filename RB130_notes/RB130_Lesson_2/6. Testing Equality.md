We already said that `assert_equal` is one of the most useful assertions, but *how* is it testing for equality?

Recall from before that equality in Ruby (or any programming language) is not a straight-forward affair.
- Are we talking object equality? Or value equality? Or both?

When using `assert_equal`, we're testing for *value equality*. 
- Specifically, we're invoking the `==` method on the object.
- If we're looking for more strict *object equality*, then we need to use the `assert_same` assertion.

Let's take a look at an example, we'll just create a temporary test file to experiment with

```ruby
require 'minitest/autorun'

class EqualityTest < MiniTest::Test
	def test_value_equality
		str1 = "hi there"
		str2 = "hi there"

		assert_equal(str1, str2)
		assert_same(str1, str2)
	end
end
```

If you run the above test, you'll see that the `assert_equal` assertion will pass
- `str1 == str2` returns true.
	- The `assert_equal` is testing for *value* equality

The second assertion, `assert_same` will fail and output the following message:

```
  1) Failure:
EqualityTest#test_value_equality [test_assertion.rb:9]:
Expected "hi there" (oid=420) to be the same as "hi there" (oid=440).

1 runs, 2 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

The failure message is interesting, as it's showing the object id for the two `String` objects.
- Notice they're not the same

`assert_same` corresponds to the object equality; they must be the same object

## Equality with a custom class

Because the Ruby core library classes all implement sensible `==` to test for value equality, we can get away with using `assert_equal` on strings, arrays, hashes, etc.
- What happens if we try to use `assert_equal` on our own custom classes?

We have to tell Minitest how to compare those objects by implementing our own `==` method.

First let's look at what happens when we try to use `assert_equal` without implementing our own `==` method.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :wheels, :name

  def initialize
    @wheels = 4
  end
end

class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def test_value_equality
    car1 = Car.new
    car2 = Car.new

    car1.name = "Kim"
    car2.name = "Kim"

    assert_equal(car1, car2)
  end
end
```

This will output:

```
# Running:

CarTest F

Finished in 0.021080s, 47.4375 runs/s, 47.4375 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
CarTest#test_value_equality [car_test.rb:48]:
No visible difference in the Car#inspect output.
You should look at the implementation of #== on Car or its members.
#<Car:0xXXXXXX @wheels=4, @name="Kim">

1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Notice the helpful failure message
- It even tells you that you need to implement an instance method called `==` in `Car`

Basically, Minitest is saying it doesn't know how to assert value equality here.

Let's implement `Car#==`.

```ruby
class Car
  attr_accessor :wheels, :name

  def initialize
    @wheels = 4
  end

  def ==(other)                       # assert_equal would fail without this method
    other.is_a?(Car) && name == other.name
  end
end
```

We can now call `assert_equal` on `Car` objects.

```ruby
class CarTest < MiniTest::Test
  def test_value_equality
    car1 = Car.new
    car2 = Car.new

    car1.name = "Kim"
    car2.name = "Kim"

    assert_equal(car1, car2)          # this will pass
    assert_same(car1, car2)           # this will fail
  end
end
```

Now that we told Ruby how to compare two `Car` objects, we can use `assert_equal`.

Notice that `assert_same` is unaffected, because it's still looking at whether the two arguments are the same actual object.
